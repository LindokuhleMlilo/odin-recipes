<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>2/3 cup milk (plus extra for brushing)</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h3>Optional Add-ins</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup raisins, currants, or dried cranberries</li>
    <li>Zest of 1 lemon or orange</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparation</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong><br>
        Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong><br>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <strong>Cut in the Butter:</strong><br>
        Add the cold, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter, fork,<br>
        or your fingertips, work the butter into the flour until the mixture<br>
        resembles coarse crumbs.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong><br>
        In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and vanilla extract.<br>
        Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.<br>
        If you’re adding dried fruit or zest, gently fold it in now.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <strong>Form the Dough:</strong><br>
        Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently<br>
        knead it a few times until it comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough.<br>
        Pat it into a 1-inch thick round.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <strong>Cut the Scones:</strong><br>
        Use a floured round cutter (about 2-2.5 inches in diameter) to cut out<br>
        scones from the dough. Gather the scraps and repeat until all the dough is used.<br>
        Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <strong>Brush with Milk:</strong><br>
        Lightly brush the tops of the scones with a bit of milk. This will help them<br>
        brown nicely in the oven.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <strong>Bake:</strong><br>
        Bake the scones in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they are<br>
        golden brown on top.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        <strong>Cool and Serve:</strong><br>
        Allow the scones to cool on a wire rack for a few minutes. Serve warm or at<br>
        room temperature with clotted cream, butter, and jam.
    </li>
